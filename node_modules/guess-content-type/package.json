Without specifying a charset explicitly, most browsers will default to ISO-8859-1, or whatever the user preference is.\n\nDon't use this module if you're not sure about the character encoding of the HTML or text content you're generating, because you'd be making things worse by specifying the wrong encoding. Check your editor's documentation first.\n\nNote that problems with encoding (at least in Western countries) will only show up when you use non-ascii characters.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar guessType = require(\"guess-content-type\")\nvar contentType = guessType(filename)\n```\n\n`contentType` is now the (guessed) media type for `filename`, or the media type including `charset=UTF-8` parameter if it's a text type. This can be put in the HTTP `Content-Type` header.\n\nFor convenience, `filename` may be an entire path or url as well.\n\n## Example guesses, used as tests\n\n```coffee\nguesses =\n  \"a.txt\":                        \"text/plain; charset=UTF-8\"\n  \"b.html\":                       \"text/html; charset=UTF-8\"\n  \".jpg\":                         \"image/jpeg\"\n  \".unknown-type\":                \"application/octet-stream\"\n  \"/\":                            \"application/octet-stream\"\n  \"/some/path\":                   \"application/octet-stream\"\n  \"http://google.com/abc.html\":   \"text/html; charset=UTF-8\"\n  \"http://google.com/abc.html?q\": \"text/html; charset=UTF-8\"\n  \"http://google.com/abc.gif?q\":  \"image/gif\"\n```\n\n\n## Credits\n\nThe initial structure of this module was generated by [Jumpstart](https://github.com/meryn/jumpstart), using the [Jumpstart Black Coffee](https://github.com/meryn/jumpstart-black-coffee) template.\n\n## License\n\nguess-content-type is released under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).  \nCopyright (c) 2013 Meryn Stol  ",
